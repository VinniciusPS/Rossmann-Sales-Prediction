# 1.0 The context

In a commercial meeting, it was verified that there was an increase in the number of local competitors. To prevent competitors from gaining market share, the representatives decided that it would be relevant to analyze the purchase data, in order to better understand the following aspects:

- What makes customers buy from Rossmann and not the competition?
- Why does the customer prefer to buy certain products from the competition and not from Rossmann?
- What are Rossmann's strengths and weaknesses and why?
- From 0 to 10, how much would the customer recommend Rossmann to a friend or family member? Why?

After the customer survey, the following insights were identified:

- Customers preferred to buy from the competition because the service was better.
- Customers bought the same product from the competition because it offered better prices.
- Customers preferred to go to the competitionâ€™s store because the physical environment were more pleasant and some even had a cafeteria chain inside them.

# 2.0 The problem
Based on the research insights, initiatives have been outlined such as: 

- Redesign the entire training program for store managers and attendants.
- Review the entire pricing strategy.
- Make partnerships with chains of coffee shops and bakeries.
- Deploy self-service totems to customers who preferred to shop without the assistance of attendants.

However, to carry out all these initiatives, well-structured financial planning with a minimum margin of error must be made so that the company wouldn't waste money during the implementation of the initiatives.

The CFO responsible for this plan had a huge difficulty to carry it out because it was necessary to know how much each store was selling and **how much it could sell in the short term**. In addition, there was no easy, automated, or convenient way to obtain this information.

# 3.0 The solution
The delivered solution was a Telegram bot. 

The user just needed to send the store number and the bot would answer the predicted **total sales that the store would made by the end of the next six weeks**.
