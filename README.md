# 1.0 The context

In a quarterly report meeting at Rossmann, the directors board identified an increase in competitors stores openings.

In order to prevent the competitors from taking part of the market share, the C-Level board decided to conduct an on-site survey with all customers who were shopping at the stores to understand the following points:

- Why did the customer preferred to buy from Rossmann and not from the competition?
- From 0 to 10, how satisfied was the customer with the Rossmann store's products and service? Why? (CSAT)
- Why were there certain products that the customer preferred to buy from the competition and not from Rossmann?
- What were, in the customers opinions, the three strengths and three weaknesses from Rossmann’s stores? Why?
- From 0 to 10, how much would the customer recommend Rossmann to a friend or family member? Why? (NPS)

After the customer survey, the following insights were identified:

- Customers preferred to buy from the competition because the service was better.
- Customers bought the same product from the competition because it offered better prices.
- Customers preferred to go to the competition’s store because the physical environment were more pleasant and some even had a cafeteria chain inside them.

# 2.0 The problem
Based on the research insights, initiatives have been outlined such as: 

- Redesign the entire training program for store managers and attendants.
- Review the entire pricing strategy.
- Make partnerships with chains of coffee shops and bakeries.
- Deploy self-service totems to customers who preferred to shop without the assistance of attendants.

However, to carry out all these initiatives, well-structured financial planning with a minimum margin of error must be made so that the company wouldn't waste money during the implementation of the initiatives.

The CFO responsible for this plan had a huge difficulty to carry it out because it was necessary to know how much each store was selling and **how much it could sell in the short term**. In addition, there was no easy, automated, or convenient way to obtain this information.

# 3.0 The solution
The delivered solution was a Telegram bot. 

The user just needed to send the store number and the bot would answer the predicted **total sales that the store would made by the end of the next six weeks**.
